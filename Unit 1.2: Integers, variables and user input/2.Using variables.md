Do you remember how variables work?

Let's consider a pollution index within a variable that is declared with the instruction:

```C
int pollution = 0;
```
The program continues, what is the value of the pollution variable after the following instruction?

```C
pollution = 34;
```
`__?__`
 
The program still continues, what is the value of the pollution variable after this instruction?

```C
pollution = pollution + 34;
```
`__?__`

And after these two instructions?

```C
pollution = pollution - 8;
```
```C
pollution = pollution - 20;
```
`__?__`

Finally, the program terminate with the following instructions:

``C`
pollution = 10;
```
```C
pollution = pollution + 12;
```
What is the value of the variable pollution after these final instructions?

`__?__`


___

# Solution

```C
int pollution = 0;
```
The program continues, what is the value of the pollution variable after the following instruction?

```C
pollution = 34;
```
`34`
 
The program still continues, what is the value of the pollution variable after this instruction?

```C
pollution = pollution + 34;
```
`68`
  
And after these two instructions?

```C
pollution = pollution - 8;
```
```C
pollution = pollution - 20;
```
`40`

Finally, the program terminate with the following instructions:

```C
pollution = 10;
```
```C
pollution = pollution + 12;
```
What is the value of the variable pollution after these final instructions?

`22`
