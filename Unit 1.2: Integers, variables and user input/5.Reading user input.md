# Reading user input
### Activity: read an integer and print the corresponding multiplication table
In this activity, you want to improve your existing multiplication program (that prints the 8 times table). Your program should read an integer from the user (not you) and print the multiplication table for the number that they enter.

#### Examples
##### Input:
```
8
```
#### Output:
```
0x8 = 0
1x8 = 8
...
10x8 = 80
```
#### Input:
```
5
```
#### Output:
```
0x5 = 0
1x5 = 5
...
10x5 = 50
```
**_Warning:_ You will be graded on your output, so do not include any print statements that prompt a user for input.**

# Solution
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    int i, num;

    scanf("%d", &num);

    for (i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
        printf("%dx%d = %d\n", i, num, i*num);
    }

    return(0);
}
```
