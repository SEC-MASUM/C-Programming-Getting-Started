# Finding the remainder
### Activity: find the remainder in integer division
You have a number of loose matches that you would like to put back into boxes. Write a program that calculates and displays how many full boxes you will have and how many leftover matches you will have after filling all the boxes you can. Your program should take as input the number of matches to be boxed up followed by the size of a each box. Next it should print out the number of full boxes followed by the number of remaining matches.

### Example
#### Input:
```
666
13
```
#### Output: 
```
51
3
```
___

# Solution
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	int matches = 1;
	int boxSize = 1;
	scanf("%d %d", &matches, &boxSize);
	printf("%d\n", matches/boxSize);
	printf("%d", matches%boxSize);
	return(0);
}
```
